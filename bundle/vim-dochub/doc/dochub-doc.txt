1. Introduction                                   *dochub*

dochub.vim quickly opens documentation from DocHub.io (http://dochub.io) for:

* CSS
* DOM
* HTML 
* JavaScript
* JQuery
* PHP
* Python

dochub.vim is enabled by 'filetype'. While editing a supported file,
simply place the cursor over a class, property, or method and type `JJ`.
The plugin will then open a new tab in your browser (or a new instance of
the browser) to the related docs. That's it.

Documentation       Vim Filetypes
CSS                 css
TML                 eruby, html, htmldjango
JavaScript          javascript
PHP                 php
Python              python

The wildcards are documentation for DOM and JQuery, since they aren't
associated to a 'filetype' they have their own mapping:

* `JD` for DOM Documentation
* `JQ` for JQuery Documentation

2. Configuration                                  *dochub-configuration*

By default, dochub.vim uses the 'open' command for OS X or the
xdg-open <http://portland.freedesktop.org/xdg-utils-1.0/xdg-open.html>
command for other OSes to look up the docs. You can easily change the command. 
For exampe:
                                                   *dochub_command*  >

    let g:dochub_command='gnome-open'

Furthermore you can choose your own mapping in the following way:
                                                   *dochub_mapping*  >

    let g:dochub_mapping='<C-h>'
